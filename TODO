* Pull jiraUrl from git config and set it on git jira init
* Require git jira init to be run before doing operations
** Check if git jira init was run before doing operations
* Support multiple projects in one repo
* Find out why logs in two times quite often
* Read from jira.url
* 'git jira describe all' will describe all branches in current repo (like CCMOC-224 and CCMOC-252)
* git jira start <branch> should search from the existing issues and start from there
** Only if there isn't any matching one should it start a new one (and only after prompting)
